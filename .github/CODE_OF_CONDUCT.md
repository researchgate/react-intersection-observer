# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment, we
as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, level of
experience, or technical ability.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

The ResearchGate community prioritizes (marginalized) people's safety over
(privileged) people's comfort.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instance of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to
this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for
other behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at
[researchgate@github.com](mailto:researchgate@github.com). All complaints will
be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regards to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
